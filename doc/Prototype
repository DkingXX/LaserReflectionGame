What we want to have in the prototype:
    Login screen
    Start at the first level
    In the level we have a laser and an endpoint.
    Mirrors can be placed to reflect the laser.
    If the laser reaches the endpoint the player wins.
    The player is able to log out.
If we have time left:
    Multiple levels
    Level select screen
